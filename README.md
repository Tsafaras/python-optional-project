# python-optional-project
An optional Python project for a class at CEID, UPatras.

The purpose of this project is to download some data from EUROSTAT's website regarding the number of tourists over a 4-year period for Greece and another country. I chose Austria, for no particular reason. The end result is 4 different graphs, 2 for each country multiplied by 2 for each different scenario, number of arrivals vs number of nights spent.
